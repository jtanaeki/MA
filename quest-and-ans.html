    <p>Right now, I’m a Senior Developer at Fleetcor. My responsibilities include delegating tasks, reviewing code, and performing some of the coding assignments.

    <h3>What is the difference between ngOnInit and constructor?</h3>
    <p>ngOnInit is a lifecycle hook that runs after the constructor and is used for “actual code work”. The constructor is the default method of a class that is used primarily to initialize class properties and dependency injection</p>

    <h3>Name and Describe some Angular Lifecycle Hooks</h3>
    <p>ngOnChanges(): called when Angular sets data-bound input properties for a component. For example, when you’re looking to watch data changes in observables.</p>
    <p>ngOnInit(): called when Angular initializes the component AFTER the input properties have been set</p>
    <p>ngDoCheck(): called when a change occurs that Angular doesn’t detect</p>
    <p>ngDestroy(): called right before Angular removes a component. For example, when unsubscribing and cleaning up data when using observables</p>

    <h3>What are Observables?</h3>
    <p>They're similar to Promises, but they're objects that allow you to emit multiple values</p>

    <h3>What is NgRx?</h3>
    <p>It's a framework, similar to Redux, that’s used for state management and to build reactive applications in angular. It involves a store, effects, reducers, and actions.</p>

    <h3>How do you implement user authentication?</h3>
    <p>You could use web tokens to create user authentication and prevent unauthorized users. It would involve building a token API to fetch the user token, and then you would store that token into session storage, local storage, or a cookie</p>

    <h3>Can you tell me about React hooks?</h3>
    <p>React hooks are used by functional components in order to access state and lifecycle methods, whereas component hooks would not need hooks. Some examples of React hooks include useState and useEffect.</p>

    <h3>What is Redux?</h3>
    <p>it’s a state management library/tool that helps maintain the state of an entire application in one single immutable state tree/object.</p>

    <h3>What’s the difference between Angular and AngularJS?</h3>
    <p>AngularJS uses an MVC design model, JavaScript, and the data between a view and a model are synchronized.</p>
    <p>Angular is a framework, uses TypeScript, and uses a component-based architecture.</p>
